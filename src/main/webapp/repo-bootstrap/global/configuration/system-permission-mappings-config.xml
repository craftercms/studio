    This file contains global permissions configuration for Crafter Studio. Permissions per site are managed
    within Crafter Studio's UI.

    The structure of this file is:
    <permissions>
        <site id="###GLOBAL###"> (global management)
            <role name="">
                <rule regex="/.*">
                    <allowed-permissions>
                        <permission>Read</permission>
                        <permission>Write</permission>
                        <permission>Delete</permission>
                        <permission>Create Folder</permission>
                         <permission>Publish</permission>
                    </allowed-permissions>
                </rule>
            </role>
        </site>
    </permissions>

    This binds a set of permissions to a role globally for the entire application.

        <name>system_admin</name>
        <allowed-permissions>
            <permission>READ_GROUPS</permission>
            <permission>Write</permission>
            <permission>Delete</permission>
            <permission>Create Folder</permission>

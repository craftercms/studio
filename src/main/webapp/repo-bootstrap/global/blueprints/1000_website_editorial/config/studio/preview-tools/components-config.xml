    This file configures the drag-and-drop components available in the Preview Tools. Those components can then
    be dragged and dropped on a drop-zone within a page.

    The structure of this file is:

    <config>
        <category> (list of components that can be created on the fly during the drag and drop)
            <label />
            <component>
                <label />
                <type /> (reference content type of the component)
                <path /> (where to store these components)
            </component>
        </category>
        <browse> (list of browse paths of where to find ready components to be dragged/dropped)
            <label />
            <path /> (where to look for)
        </browse>

<!-- role-mappings-config.xml

    This file maps groups to roles.

    The structure of this file:

    <role-mappings>
        <groups>
            <group name="site_admin">
                <role>admin</role>
            </group>
            <group name="site_developer">
                <role>developer</role>
            </group>
            <group name="site_author">
                <role>author</role>
            </group>
            <group name="site_publisher">
                <role>publisher</role>
            </group>
            <group name="site_reviewer">
                <role>reviewer</role>
            </group>
        </groups>
    </role-mappings>


    Please note that by default, sites are created with the groups and roles above. However, if LDAP authentication
    is configured, additional groups will be automatically created for the site as site members sign in via LDAP.
    Those new groups can then be mapped to roles in this file. This then allows LDAP managed users to automatically
    get roles within a site based on their LDAP group membership.

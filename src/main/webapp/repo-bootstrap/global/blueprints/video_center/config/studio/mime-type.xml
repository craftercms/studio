    This file configures the mime types icons overrides for this site/blueprint.

    For every configuration you'd like to make editable, you need:
        <mime-type>
            <type />
            <icon>
                <class />
                <styles>
                    ...
                </styles>
            </icon>
        </mime-type>

    The elements are:
    - type: The mime type. This is the target mimetype that will be affected by the new icon/styles defined on the configuration
    - class: The Font Awesome class for the icon that will be showed for the mime type.
    - styles: CSS styles for the icon selected, you can customize the icon with css like styles (e.g <color>#ffffff</color>)
